HOW TO GET RGB IN PRINTERS: ...magic?

RGBA: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (opacity)

RESOLUTION: How many pixels it has
	Used to only have a maximum of 256 colors, 320px*440px
	Now we could have a maximum of 16,777,216 colors, 12000px*15000px          (firealpaca has a maximum of 20000px*20000px)

TWO TYPES OF IMAGES:

	Raster images: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, HEIC, TIFF, PSD, WEBP, HDRI
		Also referred to as bitmap
		Made out of pixels
		Easy to make
		Can be ultra-realistic
		Takes up a lot of storage space (millions of pixels)
		Unscalable

	Vector images: SVG, EPS, AI, PDF
		Made out of shapes
		Scalable
		Doesn't take up as much storage space
		Difficult to make
		Often uses less colors
